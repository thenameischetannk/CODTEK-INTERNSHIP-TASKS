The styling and interactivity (such as adding and removing tasks) would typically be handled by the linked CSS and JavaScript files, respectively.


CSS Styling:
1.	 The below code is a CSS code that styles the layout and appearance of a To-Do list application. The code is organized into several sections based on the HTML elements being styled. Here's a breakdown of the code:
2.	Importing Font:
3.	@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@100;200;300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap');: This line imports the Google Font "Poppins" with various weights to be used throughout the document.
4.	Global Styles:
5.	*: Selects all elements on the page.
6.	margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box;: Resets margins and padding to zero and sets box-sizing to border-box for consistent layout calculations.
7.	font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;: Sets the default font family to "Poppins" with a fallback to the sans-serif font.
8.	Body Styles:
9.	body: Selects the body element.

21.	List Item Styles:
22.	. box li: Selects list items inside the box.
23.	Styles each list item, including background color, margin, padding, cursor, border radius, color, and box shadow.
24.	. box li.done: Selects list items with the class "done".
25.	Styles completed list items differently, with a different background color and a checkmark symbol.
26.	Scrollbar Styles:
27.	::-webkit-scrollbar-track, ::-webkit-scrollbar, ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb: Styles the scrollbar appearance in WebKit browsers like Chrome and Safari.
28.	These CSS styles define the appearance and layout of various elements within the to-do list application, including the container, box, input field, list items, and scrollbar. The styles aim to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for managing tasks.
JavaScript Functionality:
This JavaScript code is for a To-Do list application that allows users to add, check off, and delete tasks. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1.	Variable Declarations:
let mainBx = document.querySelector('#mainBx');: Selects the input field with the id "mainBx" and assigns it to the variable mainBx.
let list = document.querySelector('#list');: Selects the unordered list with the id "list" and assigns it to the variable list.


 2 Event Listener for Keyup:
      
mainBx.addEventListener("keyup", function(event){ ... });: Listens for keyup events                             on the mainBx input field.
Inside the event listener function:
if (event.key == "Enter"){ ... }: Checks if the key pressed is the Enter key.
      addItem(this.value): Calls the addItem function with the value of the input field as an     argument.
this.value = "": Clears the input field after adding the item.


3. add Item Function:

             let add Item = (mainBx) => {...}: Defines a function named addItem that takes a parametermainBx,
             which represents the text of the to-do item.
            Inside the function:
            let listItem = document.createElement("li");: Creates a new list item element.
listItem.innerHTML = ${mainBx}<i></i>; Sets the inner HTML of the list item, including the text of the to-do item and an empty <i> element for a checkbox.
listItem.addEventListener("click", function (){ ... });: Listens for click events on the list item.
this.classList.toggle('done');: Toggles the 'done' class on the list item, indicating whether the task is completed or not.
listItem.querySelector("i").addEventListener("click", function(){ ... });: Listens for click events on the <i> element (checkbox).
listItem.remove(); Removes the list item from the DOM when the checkbox is clicked.
list.appendChild(listItem);: Appends the list item to the unordered list.
This JavaScript code sets up functionality for adding new to-do items to the list, marking items as done when clicked, and removing items when their checkboxes are clicked. It enhances the interactivity and functionality of the to-do list application.
USAGE
1.	A to do list application is a simple yet powerful tool that can help individuals and organizations manage their tasks and workflow more efficiently. Here are some of the ways a to do list application can be used:

2.	Personal task management: a to do list application can be used to manage personal tasks such as grocery shopping, household chores, and exercise routines. By creating a list of tasks, individuals can prioritize and manage their time more effectively, reducing stress and increasing productivity.
3.	Project management: in a project management context, a to do list application can be used to break down complex projects into smaller, manageable tasks. This allows team members to track their progress and ensure that all aspects of the project are completed on time.
4.	Collaboration: a to do list application can be used as a collaboration tool, allowing team members to assign tasks to one another and track their progress. This can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals.
5.	Time management: a to do list application can help individuals and organizations manage their time more effectively. By prioritizing tasks and allocating time slots for each task, individuals can ensure that they are making the most of their time and avoiding procrastination.
6.	Goal setting: a to do list application can be used to set and track goals. By breaking down long-term goals into smaller, manageable tasks, individuals can track their progress and stay motivated.
7.	Prioritization: a to do list application can help individuals and organizations prioritize their tasks. By identifying the most important tasks and allocating resources accordingly, individuals and organizations can ensure that they are focusing on the tasks that will have the greatest impact.
8.	Stress reduction: by providing a clear overview of tasks and deadlines, a to do list application can help reduce stress and anxiety. Individuals can focus on one task at a time, knowing that they have a system in place to manage their workload.
9.	In summary, a to do list application is a versatile tool that can be used in a variety of contexts to manage tasks, collaborate with team members, manage time, set and track goals, prioritize tasks, and reduce stress.

10.	Regarding the JavaScript code you provided, it is a simple to do list application that allows users to add tasks to a list, mark tasks as complete, and remove tasks from the list. The code uses the document object model (dome) to interact with the html elements, and the local storage Api to save and retrieve the list data.

11.	The code initializes by selecting the input field, add button, and list element using the query selector method. An event listener is added to the add button, which triggers the create task function when clicked. The create task function creates a new list item, adds the user's input as the text content, and appends two span elements for the check and close buttons. The check and close buttons are given the appropriate classes for styling and functionality.

12.	An event listener is added to the list element, which triggers a function when a list item is clicked. The function checks if the clicked element is the list item, check button, or close button, and performs the appropriate action (toggling the checked class, toggling the checked class of the parent list item, or removing the list item).

13.	The save data function is called whenever a task is added, completed, or removed. The function saves the current state of the list to the local storage using the set item method. The show data function is called when the page loads, which retrieves the list data from the local storage and populates the list element.

      Overall, the code is a simple yet effective implementation of a to do list application using JavaScript and the local storage Api.

CONCLUSION: -
In conclusion, the To Do List app is a simple yet powerful tool that can help individuals and organizations manage their tasks and workflow more efficiently. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them from the list. The app also saves the data locally, so the user's tasks are preserved even if they close the browser or shut down their device.

During the development of this app, I gained valuable experience in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a functional web application. I learned how to use the Document Object Model (DOM) to interact with HTML elements, how to use event listeners to trigger functionality, and how to use the local Storage API to save and retrieve data.

Throughout the development process, I also practiced important software development skills such as debugging, testing, and iterative development. I used the console.log () method to debug my code and ensure that it was functioning as intended. I tested the app thoroughly to ensure that it was user-friendly and free of errors. I also iterated on the design and functionality of the app based on user feedback and my own observations.
