INTRODUCTION

In the realm of personal productivity and organizational tools, the to-do list occupies a central role, universally recognized for its simplicity and effectiveness in managing tasks and priorities. The evolution from paper-based lists to digital platforms has significantly expanded the functionality and accessibility of to-do lists, making them an indispensable tool for individuals looking to optimize their time and manage their responsibilities efficiently.
